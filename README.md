# Low-Poly-ZenGarden

LowPoly ZenGarden is an interactive game demo with beautiful graphics and meditative music to help players relax and peace their mind. We developed this game using C++ and OpenGL with custom shaders. Riding a lonely boat on the limpid low poly water, players can explore the procedurally generated terrain, appreciate the snow particle effects and capture great moment with depth of field camera. Feel free to check our Demo and enjoy a peaceful break.
